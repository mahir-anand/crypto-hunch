# Crypto-Hunch
CryptoHunch is a user-friendly cryptocurrency price tracker that I developed as a fun winter break project. It provides efficient real-time tracking of my favorite cryptocurrencies using CoinGecko's Rest API.

## Features
- Real-Time Tracking: Get up-to-the-minute price updates for your selected cryptocurrencies.

- User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive and easy-to-use design makes tracking cryptocurrency prices a breeze. I designed the Front End using Figma.
